Next steps:

- position mousePointer on top of actual screen Pos of cursor. Offset is happening I think on div, rather than window
- Add Touch events to use on mobile
- Create responsive layout to shrink screen to size
- Tidy graphics, remove border. Not sure about fuzzy pointers
- Make mousePointers pulse
- deploy to Heroku
